## Part
A single item or shape to be cut from material. Each part can have a specified quantity, indicating how many identical items will be cut. Parts be imported from DXF, DWG, or CSV files. For rectangular cutting, parts can also be manually defined by width and height.

## Nesting
The process of arranging parts on a sheet of material to optimize usage and minimize waste.

## Sheet
A raw material surface (such as metal, wood, glass or plastic) onto which parts are nested and cut.

## Leftover / Remnant
The remaining pieces after cutting that are still usable.

## Scrap
The remaining pieces after cutting that are no longer usable and will be disposed or recycled.

## Cutting Diagram
A visual representation showing how parts are arranged and cut from a sheet.

## Machining Time
The estimated time required to cut all parts from a sheet, based on the configured cutting velocity for each material.

## Material Efficiency
A measure of how effectively the material is used, typically expressed as a percentage of the sheet area occupied by parts.

## Minimal Leftover Size
The smallest size of remnant that will be kept for future use. Remnants smaller than this threshold are considered scrap.

## G-Code
A language used to instruct CNC machines how to cut parts from a sheet, generated from cutting diagrams.

## Subscription
A payment model allowing users to access Otimize Nesting features on a monthly basis, with no minimum period or hidden fees.
