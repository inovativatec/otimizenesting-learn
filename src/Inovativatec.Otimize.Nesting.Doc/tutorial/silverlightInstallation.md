Along the recent years, plug in technology in web browsers have been discontinued and are no longer supported, with the exception of Microsoft Edge, configured to run Otimize Nesting using Internet Explorer compatibility mode.

It is not 100% clear until when this option will be available, so we recommend using the most recent version of our product. For more details visit our [website](https://www.otimizenesting.com).
